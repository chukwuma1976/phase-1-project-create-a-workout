        <h4>How many days and how much time can you commit?</h4>
        <p>If you are really busy 2 days a week for 45 minutes each day may be pushing it.
          For most people 2-4 days per week is feasible.</p>
        <h4>What do you like to do?</h4>
        <p>If you like lifting weights do it.  If you like other forms of physical activity do that.
          The best workout is the one you like to do that you can stick to and gives you results.
        <p>You can start by selecting a workout split or customize your own split.
          Don't forget cardiovascular training.</p>
