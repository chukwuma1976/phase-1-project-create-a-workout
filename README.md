This is an application that is designed to help anybody with fitness goals create a personalized workout plan.  Everybody is different and has different needs and goals.  Therefore, if one wants to be the best version of oneself then a customized workout plan can contribute to that.  There are a multitude of ways to exericse but the best exercise is the one that you like to do and can stick to for the rest of your life.

This is more than just designing a workout plan.  This application is informative as well.  You can learn about most exercises here with brief descriptions and visuals.

It has been shown that as little as 30 minutes of resistance training a week can improve longevity.  This is why you can find various types of weight training here for different body parts.

Furthermore, the American Heart Association recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity (or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity) per week.  You can find cardiovascular exercises that can help you to your goal of 150 minutes of cardio a week.

How does this work?

There are four headers.  All headers are collapsible which conserves screen space.  

The first three headers are informative.

The first one is titled "Why workout?"  When you hover over this header with a mouse it expands and displays viable reasons for working out.

The second one is titled "Recommendations on working out."  Like the first header it expands when you hover over it and display recommendations which pertain to exercise.

The third header is titled "Click here for some information about different exercises."  It opens up to eight buttons which display a body part.  These buttons are collapsible with a click. When you click on a button it expands to display different exercises for that body part.  Furthermore, you can click on each exercise for a description and image of that lift being performed.  Each body part button is collapsible as well.

The fourth header is titled "Click here to create your workout."  It opens up to six buttons (all collapsible) which each represent a different training split.  When you click a button it provides a description of that training split.  It then asks for a training frequency.  Once you enter a training frequency, your workout days along with buttons representing body parts trained under each workout day opens up.  Each button represents a drop down menu that allows you to pick different exercises and construct a workout.
